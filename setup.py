"""
Setup file for the pygame-window package.

This file defines the package metadata and options, including the package name,
version, author information, description, long description, dependencies,
Python version requirements, and other relevant information. It also reads the
version number from a file, as well as the long description from a separate
file, to ensure consistency across the package.

The setup() function is called with the defined metadata options, which are
used by pip to install the package from the PyPI repository.
