# Pygame-Window

Pygame-Window enhances the window management capabilities of the Pygame
library. Pygame's sub-module `pygame.display` can only create one window by
default, but Pygame-Window allows for the creation of multiple windows within
the Pygame framework. This enables more complex and sophisticated applications.
Additionally, Pygame-Window provides a convenient API for managing and
manipulating these windows, making it easier to develop interactive, graphical
applications with Pygame. To create multiple windows, Pygame-Window uses
Pygame's sub-module `pygame._sdl2`, which provides access to the low-level
SDL2 library that Pygame is built upon, allowing for more fine-grained control
over window creation and management.
