    """A custom `Window` class for Pygame.

    This class is a custom class for Pygame that streamlines the creation and
    management of windows in Pygame applications. It offers a variety of
    customizable features and convenient window management functions to make
    the development process smoother and more efficient.

    Attributes:
        title (str): The title of the window, which is displayed in the
            window's title bar.
        size (Tuple[int, int]): The width and height of the window, specified
            as a tuple of integers.
        position (Union[Tuple[int, int], int]): The position of the window on
            the screen.
        fullscreen (bool): Whether the window should be displayed in
            fullscreen mode.
        visible (bool): Whether the window is currently visible.
        borderless (bool): Whether the window has a border.
        resizable (bool): Whether the user can resize the window.
        minimized (bool): Whether the window is currently minimized.
        maximized (bool): Whether the window is currently maximized.
        __window__ (sdl.video.Window): An instance of `sdl.video.Window`
            representing the window.
        __renderer__ (sdl.video.Renderer): An instance of `sdl.video.Renderer`
            associated with the window.

    Methods:
        fill(color=(0, 0, 0)): Clears the window and fills it with the
            specified color.
        update(): Updates the window to display any changes made to it.
        hide(): Hides the window.
        show(): Shows the window.
        minimize(): Minimizes the window.
        maximize(): Maximizes the window.
        destroy(): Destroys the window, freeing up system resources.
